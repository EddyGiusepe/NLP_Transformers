Meanwhile in the latest news related to cryptocurrency, China`s crackdown on cryptocurrencies spread to the country`s southwest with a campaign against misuse of electricity by bitcoin miners in Yunnan province, Reuters quoted local media reported saying this on Saturday. 
Earlier, after it was widely reported that ED has served a show cause notice to WazirX and its directors over cryptocurrency transactions worth Rs. 2,790.74 crore, India's largest cryptocurrency Exchange refuted any such notice. " WazirX is yet to receive any show cause notice from the Enforcement Directorate as mentioned in today's media reports. WazirX is in compliance with all applicable laws. We go beyond our legal obligations by following Know Your Customer (KYC) and should we receive a formal communication or notice from the ED, we'll fully cooperate in the investigation. Please note: Your funds are absolutely safe on WazirX ," tweeted the crypto exchange  
In India, despite the Supreme Court strucking down RBI 2018 circular that barred banks and financial institutions from engaging in crypto dealings, uncertainty prevails as far as crypto trading in country is concerned.
